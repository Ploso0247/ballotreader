Hey.

You're probably thinking: Where's the .exe file?

Why are there so many files?

What's a WPy64?

All pretty understandable questions, and all of which can be answered with this:

I suck at programming.

I'm not a pro programmer, and I don't know how to make everything neatly packaged into one .exe file.

Instead, the source code is all here for you to see. Which is fine. Make any modifications you want, at your own risk. 

The only files you're meant to access are the downloads folder (I recommend making a shortcut to that) and the .vbs file. DON'T MOVE THESE FILES AROUND. Create a shortcut instead.

Yes, Windows will ask you for user confirmation because the author is "unknown".

This is because I am not going to pay money to get verified by windows. This popup has nothing to do with actual security.

If you're worried about my program's security, the source code is LITERALLY HERE. You can also scan it with any antivirus you want.

So yeah. Double click on the .vbs and the program will open. I tried to make everything intuitive, but if you're ever confused go to the help page. Everything is explained there.


~~~~~~~~~LINUX USERS~~~~~~~~~~

Hello fellow Linux users. You are cooler than everyone else. You are smarter than everyone else. This means you are worthy of doing a little work yourself.

Open the .sh file and replace the path to the winpython to your installation of python. Install it if you don't have it. Then there's a pip command commented out in the .sh file that should have all the dependencies. Install those then try running the .sh after giving it permission to be run. If it has dependencies errors, just keep installing the missing dependencies. When it works, it works.

Also, go to pypeteer-chrome/chrome-linux and make sure you make chmod the chrome file so that it's executable too. 

Thank you for being a linux user.
