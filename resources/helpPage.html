    <h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>
    <p><strong>Q: How do I view speaker points?</strong></p>
    <p>A: When you have the ballot open, hover over your overall speaker points. Individual speaker points are not available in the downloads unfortunately.</p>
    <p><strong>Q: Why do I need to put in my email and password?</strong></p>
    <p>A: The program needs them to send to NCFCA's server. Otherwise NCFCA won't be willing to send ballot information to the program. If you were able to read your ballots without entering any information, then wouldn't EVERYONE be able to read your ballots?</p>
    <p><strong>Q: Why are you making this?</strong></p>
    <p>A: I'm making this because 20% it's fun, but 80% because NCFCA has done so much for me, it's only fair I give a little back. So here you go: a free, fast way to view better-looking ballots, instantly compute statistics, and download ballots at 1/175th of NCFCA's file size.</p>
    <p><strong>Q: What's next?</strong></p>
    <p>A: At the time of writing, the plan is to work with Andrew Wales, the current competitor responsible for the National AL sheet, to make a AL sheet in the program. That auto-updates. Also planning on debugging as much as possible, and in the far far future, maybe a free clone of extemp g3nie. All in the ballot reader! Not even sure if that's possible though.</p>
    <p><strong>Q: I fetched some ballots and the program crashed!</strong></p>
    <p>A: Some of NCFCAs ballots are "corrupted" for lack of a better word. They are missing crucial data. These are EXTREMELY rare (in all 1000+ ballots I've tested, only 1 was corrupted). If I find a corrupted ballot, I fix the code so that it handles it. You'll notice a corrupted ballot because a small red error line will fly by the log. To avoid this, keep restarting the program and deselecting certain tournaments and speeches and debate styles until eventually you narrow down which round is causing the issue. Then selectively DON'T fetch ballots from that round.</p>
    <p><strong>Q: When I try to download ballots, the program stops responding!</strong></p>
    <p>A: This can happen if your computer gets overloaded with information. Try downloading fewer ballots at a time, downloading in PDF format, or viewing the ballots first. If you're interested, the technical reason for this is that you've sent hundreds of asynchronous requests to NCFCA's server, and you're also loading your system up with tons of processing of those ballots. It ends up just being too much for the program to handle.</p>
    <p><strong>Q: The program froze/crashed! How do I fix it?</strong></p>
    <p>A: Generally, the best solution is just to restart the program. If that doesn't work, you should click the "Running out of Storage?" button on the options page. This will force you to sign in again, but it should fix the problem.</p>
    <p><strong>Q: Are there going to be updates?</strong></p>
    <p>A: Yes! There's a "Check for updates" button on the home page. Click that to check if there are any. At the time of writing, the plan is to work with Andrew Wales, the current competitor responsible for the National AL sheet, to code an AL sheet into the program. That auto-updates. Also planning on debugging as much as possible, and in the far far future, maybe a free clone of extemp g3nie. All in the ballot reader! Not even sure if that's possible though.</p>
    <p><strong>Q: I still have questions. Where can I contact you?</strong></p>
    <p>A: On discord, it's ploso0247. My email is <a href="mailto:trumanjp@att.net">trumanjp@att.net</a>. I prefer discord. Might not see your email.</p>

    <h1 style="color: darkred">The following text is NOT necessary to read. <!--If you're familiar with programming, there are some suggestions. -->If you want in-depth explanations about different components, they're here too.</h1>

    <!-- <h2 id="suggestions">Developer Suggestions</h2>
    <p>Here are some suggestions and modifications you can make if you're familiar with Python and programming as a whole. If you aren't, I probably wouldn't recommend you do any of these.</p>
    <ol>
    <li>
    <h4></h4>
    <p></p>
    </li>
    </ol> -->
    <p><em>Let me know if you think of any other suggestions.</em></p> -->
    <h2 id="home">Home page</h2>
    <h4><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Home label</span></h4>
    <p>The help label (self.home_label) is text you see on the front of the home page. It includes a quick walkthrough in case you're confused..</p>
    <h4><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Check for updates button</span></h4>
    <p>The updates button (self.check_for_updates_button) calls the checkForUpdates() function to download the log.json file from the github repo where these files are hosted (and updated). If the log.json contains a new version, a message box will pop up, asking you if you want to update with the details that are included. If the log.json matches up with your local log.json, then there's no update. DO NOT SPAM THIS BUTTON. Github limits how many times you can use its api. If you spam it, you won't be able to check for updates for a while.</p>
    <h4><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Log</span></h4>
    <p>The log (self.error_label) is... the log. It lets you see anything important that's happening. Good things are green; bad things are red; important things are bolded or underlined.</p>
    <h2 id="options">Sign-In/Options page</h2>
    <h4><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Email label and input</span></h4>
    <p>The email label (self.email_label) is just the text that tells you where to put the email. The email input (self.email_input) is the actual line that you edit. When you open the program, this is automatically set to the email saved on-file if you have that option selected.</p>
    <h4><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Password label and input</span></h4>
    <p>The passowrd label (self.password_label) is just the text that tells you where to put the password. The password input (self.password_input) is the actual line that you edit. It is set to echo mode, so you can't see the characters. When you open the program, this is automatically set to the password saved on=file if you have that option selected.</p>
    <h4><u>Sign in button</u></h4>
    <p>The sign in button (self.fetch_data_button) calls the self.get_info() function, which calls the global fetchInfo class. In short, it takes your email and password, uses it to get a session token from NCFCA, then uses that token to request preliminary data to populate your tournaments, speeches, and debate style checkboxes. The session token is saved for the rest of the time you have the program open, and it is used to fetch ballots. The login info and raw data that is fetched from this button is saved so that you can sign in offline. If the option is selected, this button will also update the current saved login.</p>
    <h4><u>Log</u></h4>
    <p>The log (self.error_label) is... the log. It lets you see anything important that's happening. Good things are green; bad things are red; important things are bolded or underlined. It's literally the same thing as the home page.</p>
    <h4><u>Tournament not here? button</u></h4>
    <p>The Tournament not here? button (self.refresh_button) calls the self.get_info() function, passing in a variable to rescan NCFCA for new tournament information. This button is convenient if you've used ballot reader before, but now a tournament has just passed and you need to get the information without clearing the database. Just click this button and all the new ballot information will get saved. The special variable that's passed into the get_info() function bypasses most of the fetchInfo methodology just to get the raw ballot data used to repopulate the checkboxes.</p>
    <h4><u>Years checkbox</u></h4>
    <p>The years checkbox (self.years_group) isn't really a checkbox. It's a series of buttons that lets you select the year. Clicking a new year calls the get_info() function with a year parameter, which then either fetches raw data from NCFCA about the new year, or it loads it from saved data. Checking a year will gray it out and mark it "(Selected)". It also updates the speeches, debate styles, and tournaments checkboxes.</p>
    <h4><u>Tournaments checkbox</u></h4>
    <p>This checkbox (self.tournament_group) lets you select what tournaments you want to fetch from. The top checkbox will select all of the tournaments, regardless of how many are checked. The values in this checkbox are checked when you fetch ballots.</p>
    <h4><u>Speeches checkbox</u></h4>
    <p>This checkbox (self.speech_group) lets you select what speeches you want to fetch. The top checkbox will select all of the speeches, regardless of how many are checked. The values in this checkbox are checked when you fetch ballots.</p>
    <h4><u>Debate Styles checkbox</u></h4>
    <p>This checkbox (self.debate_group) lets you select what debate styles you want to fetch. Selecting more than one debate style isn't tested very much. There is no all debates button because there just aren't enough different styles. The values in this checkbox are checked when you fetch ballots.</p>
    <h4><u>Options checkbox</u></h4>
    <p>This checkbox (self.settings_group) lets you change some settings.</p>
    <p>The remember my login setting, on enabling, will check what's currently in the email/password bar and save them. Every time you click the sign-in button, this saved data is updated. On disabling, it erases the current saved data, if there is any.</p>
    <p>The sign me in automatically setting is only available if remember my login is enabled and offline mode is disabled. When enabled, this setting signs you in automatically with the saved login info as soon as you open the ballot reader.</p>
    <p>The select most recent tournament and speeches automatically setting, when enabled, will automatically select the most recent tournament, all speech categories, and the top debate style every time the checkboxes are updated. There's no real reason to disable this option.</p>
    <p>The restore legacy styling option is purely stylistic. The OG, legacy graphics were very basic. The only styles that were present in the OG graphics were a green menu background and transparent buttons. That's it. Only competitors who volunteered for Alpha testing, before Nats 2024, got these graphics naturally. When disabled by default, the new, better graphics take precedence.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The offline mode setting disables any access to NCFCA's servers. This means you can only view ballots you've viewed before, and you cannot fetch any new ballots.</p>
    <p>The automatically install updates setting automatically checks for updates and installs them without you having to do anything. Don't enable this unless you trust me.</p>
    <p>The never save any ballot data setting never saves any data to your device, so using the program requires internet all the time. That's why it automatically disables offline mode. It makes the program slower and is only really intended to be used for testing or maybe if you're having a lot of bugs. The only other reason is if you SUPER don't trust me, and you want to make sure that absolutely nothing of yours will get saved to your computer.</p>
    <h4><u>Running out of storage on your computer? button</u></h4>
    <p>Clicking this button (self.erase_databases_button) brings up a confirmation window with most of the explanation. Interestingly, it's all a lie. Removing each saved ballot and each saved image is pretty resource-intensive, so instead of doing that, the program actually deletes entire folders in which each of these are stored, and then recreates a new folder with the same name, which has the same ultimate outcome, but it's just a bit faster. A restart is required after erasing this data because whenever you start the program, all the files are loaded into memory. So in order to actually experience the effects of the reset, the program needs to be restarted. I don't know what issues will arise if you keep using the program after everything has been erased. Side-note: the program is known to get a little emotional when you wipe the database. Tread lightly.</p>
    <h4><u>Fetch Selected Ballots button</u></h4>
    <p>The fetch selected ballots button (self.fetch_ballots_button) calls the self.get_ballots() function, which calls the global fetchBallots class. In short, it takes your year, tournaments, speeches, and debates that you've selected. Then, it checks if it has the corresponding ballots saved already. If it does, it just processes the saved info. If it doesn't. It uses the id token from the login to fetch the remaining ballots from NCFCA's server. Then, it takes all the ballot info and processes it into renderable html and a very very low-quality image to use as the preview. Then it adds those to the saved ballots file and throws them into the view ballots page!</p>
    <h2 id="viewballots">View Ballots page</h2>
    <h4><u>View ballots label</u></h4>
    <p>This label (self.view_ballots_label) exists if no ballots have been fetched yet. As soon as they have, it disappears.</p>
    <h4><u>Ballots grid</u></h4>
    <p>This grid (self.gridLayout) is the grid that contains all of the ballots. Each ballot actually takes up 3 rows and 1 column of space. The top row is for the tournament label, the middle row is for the preview image, and the bottom row is for the button to view the ballot and the download button. The download button will download the ballot into the downloads folder as a pdf. See what cool things you learn when you read this stuff?</p>
    <h2 id="stats">Stats page</h2>
    <h4><u>Stats label</u></h4>
    <p>This label (self.stats_label) exists if no ballots have been fetched yet. As soon as they have, it disappears and stats replace it.</p>
    <h4><u>Stats dropdowns</u></h4>
    <p>These dropdowns (created in computeStats() in self.setup_stats()) let you view stats for your ballots. The top one computes stats across all tournaments, all speeches, all debates. Each one below that is named after a tournament, and computes states for all speeches and all debates under that tournament. Each dropdown has a number of statistics you can look at. It starts with stats for each debate category. Then you can look at speech stats across all your categories. Then you can look at speech stats per category. These dropdowns need to be clicked twice the first time you open them. I don't know why.</p>
    <h2 id="downloads">Downloads page</h2>
    <h4><u>Downloads label</u></h4>
    <p>This label (self.downloads_label) just explains how to use the download page. You're kind of an idiot if you really needed me to explain that.</p>
    <h4><u>Log</u></h4>
    <p>The log (self.error_label) is...&nbsp;STILL THE LOG. Literally nothing different from the options page or the home page.</p>
    <h4><u>Options grid</u></h4>
    <p>This grid (self.downloadsGrid) contains the exact same options as on the Options page. In fact, every time you switch between pages, the program removes the options from the other page and moves them over to this page. So they are LITERALLY the same thing. Selecting the options in this grid do the same thing as on the options page.</p>
    <h4><u>Download in PDF button</u></h4>
    <p>This button (self.download_ballots_button_PDF) calls the get_ballots() function, but this time with a parameter: download="PDF". With this parameter, the get_ballots() function performs the same checks, like checking the checkboxes, finding the balots that are already saved and using those, and querying NCFCA for any new ballots. But instead of rendering preview images or adding the ballots to the view ballots page, the function ends, and the rest of hte download process is managed back in the main class. After the ballots are fetched, they are converted asynchronously into PDFs. If the PDF has been processed before, it simply copies the stored file to the downloads folder. Otherwise, it renders it by itself.</p>
    <h4><u>Download in JSON button</u></h4>
    <p>This button (self.download_ballots_button_JSON) does the exact same thing as the PDF button, but with JSON. In case you want to look at the JSON for this ballot. Might be fun? Downloading in JSON is faster than PDF as well.</p>
    <h4><u>Download in DOCX button</u></h4>
    <p>This button (self.download_ballots_button_DOCX) does the exact same thing as the PDF button. Once the pdfs are created (or if they already existed), it converts a copy of the pdfs into docs. This is why it's the slowest option. And obviously, if the docx file is already saved, it skips all of this and just copies the saved doc to the downloads folder.</p>
    <h2 id="help">Help page</h2>
    <h4><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Help</span></h4>
    <p>Dude. Literally this.</p>
    <h2 id="support">Support</h2>
    <p>This button isn't actually a page. It's just a link that takes you to a paypal, encouraging you to donate! The software will always be free for you, but that doesn't make it free for me.</p>
